# Breast Cancer Probability Prediction

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide a probability of how possible it is to have breast cancer based on the texture mean and the radius mean. This model is trained on 570 cases and aims to assist in preliminary assessments and educational purposes.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python:** Ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
